# Memory-card

In this project, I will be creating a simple memory game to practice and apply what I have learned thus far with ReactJS. This is a project from The Odin Project curriculum. I will be using hooks to manage and utliize state while fetching and using data from an external API.

The goal is for the user to increase their score by clicking the cards without clicking on the same card twice.
